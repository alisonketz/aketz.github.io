I am an ecological statistician/quantitative ecologist and a research scientist at the  <a href="https://www.coopunits.org/Wisconsin_Wildlife/" target="_blank"><font color="brown"> Wisconsin Cooperative Research Unit</font></a> in the <a href="https://forestandwildlifeecology.wisc.edu/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology</font></a> at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I work closely with faculty at UW Madison, with ecologists and statisticians at the <a href="https://forestandwildlifeecology.wisc.edu/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">U.S. Geological Survey National Wildlife Research Center</font></a>, and with ecologists at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.
<br /><br />
I am interested in developing and applying novel statistical methods to improve basic environmental science, while simultaneously trying to make that science more relevant to society. Broadly speaking, my goal is to use ideas from theoretical ecology to optimize natural resource management under uncertainty, and to further learn about ecological theory given new data under environmental change.
<br /><br />
I believe in leading with curiousity. Advancement of science, and it's use in society, is predicated on the desire to learn. Questions always lead to further questions at all scales. I am fascinated by the abstract beauty of how mathematics and statistics can describe life on earth, and how we leverage these abstractions to further understanding in the era of global change.
<br /><br />
My research interests are focused in 4 major areas:
<br /><br />
## Statistical Ecology -
    1. Development of complex statistical models to analyze ecological data, particularly in a Bayesian framework
    2. Development and application of machine-learning algorthims to help with ecological prediction, and to aid new sampling methods
    3. Advance spatial ecology through noise reduction of large data sets
<br /><br />
## Population Ecology -
    1. Development of integrated population models, to forecast under varying management actions.
    2. Thresholds
<br /><br />
## Disease Ecology -
    1. Study the effects of environmental, genetic, and population drivers of disease dynamics.
    2. Development of spatial and temporal disease models
<br /><br />
## Movement Ecology -
    1. The connection between behavior, space use, contact rates and disease dynamics
