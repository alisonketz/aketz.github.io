### Overview


####Statistical Ecology

A core component of my work is at the interface of statistics and ecology; I address methodological and computational problems that arise during analysis of ecological data. For example, problems pertaining to integration of multiple datasets, optimal sampling design, historical data, convenience sampling, and missing data. We address these problems for case studies and ultimately apply them to answer particular management concerns.

I have worked on numerous statistical ecology problems including hierarchical Bayesian models, occupancy models, generalized linear mixed models, sensitivy analysis of stochastic population models, integrated population models, hidden Markov models, and so on. One of my strengths is deciphering obtuse statistically oriented literature and applying these methods to ecology from other fields.

During my PhD, I worked on the development of an N-mixture mixture model that combined data on movement, survival, and transect count surveys to estimate the population of elk in Rocky Mountain National Park. In my current post, I am developing numerous approaches to model continuous time-to-event models for both survival and disease transmission, as well as a spatio-temporal integrated population model (see below). I am currently working on development and application of a novel machine-learning algorithm to help with prediction of births of white-tailed deer.

#### Population Ecology

* Development of integrated population models, to forecast under varying management actions.
* Development of spatio-temporal time-to-event known fate survival models

#### Disease Ecology

* Studying the effects of environmental, genetic, and population drivers of disease dynamics.
* Development of spatial and temporal force of infection disease models

#### Movement Ecology

* The connection between behavior, space use, contact rates and disease dynamics
